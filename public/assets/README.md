# Portfolio Assets

Place your files here:
- Resume PDF (e.g., `Vardhan_Resume.pdf`)
- Project images
- Profile photos
- Other media files

Note: The Resume component references `/assets/Vardhan_Resume.pdf`, so make sure to place your resume PDF in the `public/assets/` folder with that exact name, or update the path in `Resume.jsx`.
